# FPL Team Optimizer

A comprehensive data science platform that automates optimal Fantasy Premier League team selection using machine learning predictions and mathematical optimization algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system combines machine learning and mathematical optimization to build optimal FPL squads through a multi-phase pipeline:

1. **Data Pipeline:** Automated data collection and processing  
2. **Feature Engineering:** 189 comprehensive features per player  
3. **ML Prediction:** Position-specific LightGBM models for RAW point prediction  
4. **Team Optimization:** Mixed Integer Programming for squad selection  

---

## 📊 Key Results

- 21% more accurate than individual predictions  
- +30–36 point improvements over current teams  
- 77% success rate across gameweeks  
- <30 second optimization time
